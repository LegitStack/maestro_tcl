we have several problems:

0. the node id in connectom is not acurate at all.
1. action cells aren't connecting to anything! - all zeros.
2. once that's fixed we have to fix the intuition removeZeros
3. and alreadyBeenTried
4. and splitNode (into input state, and action to take)
5. and then finish up the recall main where we loop through intuition to get a path.
